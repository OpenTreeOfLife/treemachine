# nontrivialaugmenting synthesis test

This is designed as an extension of trivialconf, but the new taxa from tree 2 are not all added near the tips

Tree1 is once again much less complete:

    (((A,B),C),D);

but compatible with tree2:

    (((A,E),B),F);

the taxonomy is a polytomy of the groups
