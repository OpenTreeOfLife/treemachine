# overlapthroughtaxon synthesis test

An example where two trees with fully nonoverlapping sampling have internal nodes which both overlap with the same taxon. The resulting synthesis tree should contain a node that contains the corresponding subtrees from both input trees as well as the rest of the taxa included in the taxon node to which they should both be mapped.
