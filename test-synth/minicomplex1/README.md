# minicomplex1 synthesis test

This is designed to give an example that requires a little forward looking to make a decision that is consistent with tree1. 
The rankings are tree1,tree3,tree2 (note that tree3 is out of order for the rankings). 

Tree1 is once again much less complete:

    ((A,B),(E,F));

and compatible with tree2:

    (A,((C,D),((E,F),(G,I))));

and tree3 is not compatible with all of tree2 and missing the resolution of E,F

    (J,(((D,E),C),((G,H),I)));

The taxonomy is a polytomy of the groups.

The expected tree is:
