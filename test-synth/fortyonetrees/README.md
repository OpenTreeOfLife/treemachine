# fortyonetrees synthesis test

A challenge to the combinatorics of the relationship selection procedure, and an interesting symmetrical problem for tree order and synthesis. Each tree mapping introduces new nodes that the former trees could be mapped to.

Currently, this is a mess. Need to ensure taxonomy gets lowest ranking before it will be useful.
