Objectives of this effort:

* present synthesis in a formal, concise way
* articulate formally what problem is to be solved. One attempt is [here](https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/treemachine/wiki/maxweightofinputtreeedgesdisplayed), but there may be other problem statements that are more appealing.
* document the control structure used in TAG generation
* analyze time and space complexity
* relate to literature on RCC-5 articulations
* make a model-theoretically clear distinction between syntax (data
  structures) and semantics (biology)
